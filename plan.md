# Rooted Productivity

## Commitment
I commit to following the processes on this document, and evaluating these processes at least twice a year to drop what’s not working, refine what needs improvement, and add new ideas.

## Daily
*	**Pray** – read a brief devotional and spend 5 minutes praying before I start the work day
*	**Focus** – review the weekly high-impact deliverable list, and select the ones I will work on today
*	**Schedule** – if there is unscheduled time in the calendar, block it off with a specific deep work task
*	**Refresh** – take a 30-minute walk, outdoors as often as weather permits during the workday
*	**Respond** – take at least 30 minutes to check in on all communication forums: chat, email, JIRA; respond to open questions as possible, and send status updates when needed
*	**Delegate** – pick at least one thing to delegate to a more junior employee

## Weekly
*	**Focus** – list the key, high-impact deliverables for the week+ to come
*	**Connect** – take at least 2 minutes to have a personal, non-work-related conversation with everyone I work with on a routine basis
*	**Work deeply** – look at the week+ ahead and intentionally block of deep work time with a specific deep work task; plan ahead to block distraction and be unreachable
*	**Savor** – at least once a week, eat lunch somewhere other than my desk
*	**Mentor** – share feedback, encouragement, support with at least one junior employee each week 

## Monthly
* **Acknowledge** – give a P2P award to someone who did good work this month
* **Develop** – pick one thing to learn more about relevant to my work
*	**Share** – identify topics for presentation and publication relevant to my work
